# PacomprarServer

PacomprarServer is the backend for a web auction platform developed with Django and Django REST Framework. It enables the management of auctions, bids, ratings, comments, and users, providing a robust and secure API for frontend and mobile applications.

## Main Features

- **Bidding:** Users can place bids on open auctions, with price and state control.
- **Ratings:** Users can rate auctions and view the average rating.
- **Comments:** Comment system for each auction.
- **Categories:** Organize auctions by category.
- **Users:** Registration, JWT authentication, profile, password change, and user management.
- **Pagination & Filtering:** Support for pagination, search, and advanced filtering in endpoints.
- **Security:** Custom permissions for each resource and JWT authentication.
- **OpenAPI Documentation:** Automatically generated with drf-spectacular.
- **CORS:** Configuration to allow access from different origins.

## Technologies Used

- Django 5.2
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- drf-spectacular (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- JWT (rest_framework_simplejwt)
- dotenv (environment variables)
- CORS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Configure the database and environment variables in `.env`.
4. Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate`.
5. Start the server with `python manage.py runserver`.

## Deployment on Render

PacomprarServer is deployed using [Render](https://render.com/), a cloud platform for hosting web services. Render automates the deployment process, making it easy to keep your application up-to-date and scalable.

### Key points for Render deployment:

- **Automatic Deploys:** Every push to the main branch triggers a new deployment.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive data and configuration are managed securely via the Render dashboard.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL is provisioned and managed by Render, with connection details set in the `.env` file.
- **Static Files:** Static and media files can be served using Render's static site service or external storage (e.g., AWS S3).

For more details, see the [Render documentation](https://render.com/docs/deploy-django).
